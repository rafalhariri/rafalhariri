 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rafal
I am passionate about the tech space and using data analytics to drive growth which motivated me to use my engineering skills in a fast paced environment.

With 4 years' experience in a start-up, I have proven ability to set up operations in a new country. I have led the quality management in one of the fastest growing markets for an on-demand home service App that connects service providers with customers. I have also worked with cross-functional teams from marketing to business development to enhance brand reputation and drive growth. From a one-woman show, I have led a team of 4 executives across KSA to manage day-to-day operations.
